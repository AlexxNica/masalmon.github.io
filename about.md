Hej! 

My last name is Salmon, like the fish, and my first name, Maëlle, is derived from a Celtic word that means princess or chief. It's pronounced "Ma-El" as "ma" in "macaroni" and as the Spanish "El". The accent on the e in ë doesn't change the pronounciation, so I guess it's my crown.

Science took me places in Europe.

I made this map with [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

This webpage is quite empty for now. In the meantime you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon).
